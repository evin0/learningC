This repository contains files from a Coursera course I'm currently taking during my
Winter 2021 break. The course is about programming in C. I have taken a course at my
community college on C Programming but it was over a year ago, so I have forgotten some
of the syntax. I'm taking this course a refresher, so I can be prepared for when I take
CSE 101 at UCSC which is data structures and algorithms in C/C++.
